**"Blog will be simple," I said.**

**"You are an experienced engineer, it's just web stuff," I said.**

***"Oh no,"*** **I said.**

Well, I was kinda right in the end.

Welcome to my blog. I don't really have a particular goal in mind yet for it, I just know that I wanted to do it. I
think I told myself a few times that I wouldn't go too deep — that this is just to understand full stack memes... (*I
still don't understand full stack memes*)...

…the truth is I feel horribly incompetent all the time. I’m self-taught, I didn’t finish my degree (for various reasons,
maybe that’ll be a later post), and I feel like I’m constantly the dumbest one in the room when I’m around other
engineers. The only salve I've found over the years for this constant feeling of ‘not enough’ is to keep learning; to
keep feeding the endless starvation for knowledge. I don't know many other people like me, but I’d like to. So here we
are.

So what even *is* this blog?

Well, in the future? Maybe something interesting to me as a complete full stack project. For now? This is what I’ve done
so far:

- Secured a domain name
- Created an empty Next.js app
- Deployed it with Vercel
- Started with post loading
- Realized through searching that people generally use CMS to handle post loading
- “Im way too cool for that”
- Implement post loading
- Implement post metadata caching, hashing posts to force regeneration on edit
- Implement byte limited infinite scroll based on cached post sizes
- Learn the difference between normal .ts scripts and react components
- Brain boom at generative html (i did like 2 months of web stuff pre-angular days for a very small, not very hip,
  company)
- Start componentizing everything like you would do with gamedev
- Figure out how to use tailwind
- Struggle with tailwind
- Continue to have fun?... after getting tailwind to work

Right now this isn't much, and I'm sure any experienced fullstack could’ve done this in an hour, instead of a weekend.
But y’know? It was fun. It was a nice escape from the c++ system work I’m used to - it lets me keep learning. For a bit,
that starvation is a little more bearable. I’ll most likely catalog a bit of the process here in following posts, and as
I go, when I feel like I’m missing a feature, I’ll try to support it. Maybe in the end I’ll have my first ever open
source library CMS to give to the world.

**Thanks for coming.**
